# GCC Hackathon

## What is a hackathon?

Hackathons are driven by the people who attend them. Participants propose and coalesce around a set of core goals and projects beforehand, or early on the first day, and then spend the rest of their time working together towards those goals. It’s an intense event at which people with different backgrounds and skills collaborate hands on and face to face to create deliverables that are useful to the community as a whole. Hackathons gather people in a room, where they can focus on the task at hand, free of distractions.

### Schedule

Hackathons are self-organizing events; any attempt to impose something as detailed as an agenda we encourage you to meet with resistance and humor. With that in mind, our schedule provides the absolute minimum amount of structure needed to ensure that something actually gets done.

The hackathons are “officially” scheduled for two days, starting on Monday, June 26\. (Note that the second day overlaps with the [first day of training](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/training).) However, we put “official” in quotes because we encourage activity to continue throughout the conference and afterwards as well. If you have experience with hackathons, you will know that follow-up is key. The project will do all it can to support follow-up efforts. We very much want to make sure that the efforts from each hackathon make it into the wild. In particular, this applies to those involved in projects that aim at a publication to work together to finalize it.

The ideal is for all of the efforts from both GCC2017 hackathons to make it into the Galaxy codebase, with downstream tutorials demonstrating best practice analysis models as an additional potential result for those interested.

### **Minimum amount of structure**

#### Pre-Hackathon

One challenge with hackathons is getting things done in the short amount of time during the event itself. To optimize productivity, we’ll use GitHub to track ideas and progress. This helps organize both ideas and people into concrete projects and teams. The hackathon organizers will be active contributors, both to seed ideas (add your own as well, please!) and offer commentary on proposed projects. We’ll use GitHub throughout the event to keep track of project status and changes.

##### Day 1: Monday, June 26

Welcome and participant introductions. Participants will have a few minutes each to say who they are and what they’re interested in hacking on. We’ll have brief task proposals, followed by some Brownian motion and coalescing into groups of folks who want to work on similar things. The rest of the day will be filled with hacking, lunch, hacking, dinner, more hacking.

##### Day 2: Tuesday, June 27

Hackathon activities continue. We’ll have project status updates in the morning, fill the day with hacking, and have one final gathering in the evening with plenty of time for showing off achievements. [GCC2017 training](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/training) starts today, and this marks the official end of the hackathon.

##### Days 3-5: Wednesday-Friday, June 28-30

The official hackathons are over, but we strongly encourage teams to continue working together throughout the remainder of GCC2017.


##### After GCC2016

Join us on [IRC (irc.freenode.net, #galaxyproject)](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Support/IRC) and keep on hacking! Not sure how to use IRC? See the [GalaxyProject.org IRC Support](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Support/IRC) wiki.
